<h3>Hello, this is our submission for the Project for our Web Engineering course.</h3>
<br/>
<p>We just wanted to note, that the website wont be functional unless its hosted on a webserver. You can either set up a localhost, or use an IDE that has a build in webserver.</p>
<br/>
<p>For starting the Website, its best ti start the index.html and go from there</p>
<br/>
<p>Kind regards,<br/>Amon Maier, Marie Wolf & Maximilian Reiter</p>
